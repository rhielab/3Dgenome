## Figure2 Comparison of Micro-C data in different read depth sequencing.

### 2B. Numbers of loops identified by Mustache at different resolutions from Hi-C 1 billion, Micro-C 1 billion, Micro-C 2 billion, and Micro-C 3 billion data are shown.

We use the loop data genrated by Mustache (Roayaei Ardakany et al., 2020) for different libraries (Hi-C 1 billion; Micro-C 1,2,3 billion data) at 1kb, 2kb, 5kb, 10kb, 25kb, 50kb respectively. The plot is showing the number of loops we get at different different resolutions among libraries.
