## Figure6 Nucleosome phasing and DNA methylation levels around regulatory elements involved in loops.

### 6(B) Average chromatin accessibility levels (%) of active promoters, enhancers, insulators, and NDRs without features that are in loop (black) vs those that are not in loop (orange) are shown. 6(C) Average DNA methylation levels of active promoters, enhancers, insulators, and NDRs without features that are in loop (black) vs those that are not in loop (orange) are shown.

Panel C and D are generated using Bistools (Lay et al, 2015). Please check their github for more usage instruction (https://github.com/dnaase/Bis-tools).
