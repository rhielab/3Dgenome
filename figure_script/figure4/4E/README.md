## Figure4 Regulatory elements and nucleosome-depleted regions (NDRs) that are involved in loops.

### 4(E) Significance of chromatin interaction (q-value identified by Mustache) for top 5 loop categories. A mean q-value is shown in red. A median q-value is shown in blue.

Here we just show an example Rscript to generate the q-value violin plot of different chromatin interactions. Please noted that you need to first generate loop with regulatory element categories, as described in [figure_script/figure4/4A.B.C](https://github.com/rhielab/3Dgenome/tree/main/figure_script/figure4/4A.B.C).
