This figure is about the regulatory elements (Promoter, Enhancer, Insulator, NDR, repressed regions etc.) involved in loops. We used ChIP-seq data of histone marks (Promoter - H3K4me3, Enhancer - H3K27ac, Repressed - H2K27me3 etc.) as well as CTCF to identify these regions. We processed ChIP-seq data based on the pipeline from ENCODE. Please check https://www.encodeproject.org/chip-seq/histone/
