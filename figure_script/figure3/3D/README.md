## Figure3 Chromatin loops near structural variants.

### 3(D) Numbers of neoloops (loops newly gained due to the structural variants) that are shared (between any datasets) or unique among Hi-C 1 billion, Micro-C 1 billion, 2 billion and 3 billion data are shown.

Here is the loop-comparison analysis, we used the same script as desribed in [figure_script/figure2/2D](https://github.com/rhielab/3Dgenome/tree/main/figure_script/figure2/2D). Please refer for more details.
