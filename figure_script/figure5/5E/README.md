## Figure5 Promoter capture Micro-C data analysis.

### 5(E) Numbers of loops and loop categories identified from promoter capture Micro-C data.

The analysis is bacially the stats from the regulatory elements distribution analysis among promoter capture Micro-C libraries. Please refer to [figure_script/figure4/4A.B.C](https://github.com/rhielab/3Dgenome/tree/main/figure_script/figure4/4A.B.C) for such analysis.
