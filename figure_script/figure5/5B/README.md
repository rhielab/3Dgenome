## Figure5 Promoter capture Micro-C data analysis. 

### 5B. Chromatin interaction heatmaps of Micro-C and promoter capture Micro-C data near chr1q41 region at 2kb (top), 5kb (middle), and 10kb (bottom) resolutions.

We used cooltools to generate the chromaitn interaction heatmap. Please refer to [figure_script/figure1/1B](https://github.com/rhielab/3Dgenome/tree/main/figure_script/figure1/1B) for the usage.
