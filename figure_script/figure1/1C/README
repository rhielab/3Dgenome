The script topdom_comparison.R shows how we perform the overlap analysis using the TAD data generated from TopDom (Shin H et al, Nucleic Acids Res, 2016).

The inputs are the TAD bed files generated by TopDom. Output is showing the shared TAD number.

NOTED: To run TopDom, we first run the 4DN Hi-C data processing pipeline (https://data.4dnucleome.org/resources/data-analysis/hi_c-processing-pipeline) to get the HiC file, which is the required input for TopDom.
