## Figure1 Comparison of Hi-C and Micro-C data.

### 1C. Venn diagram of TADs identified from Hi-C and Micro-C.

The script ```topdom_comparison.R``` shows how we perform the overlap analysis using the TAD data generated from TopDom (Shin H et al, Nucleic Acids Res, 2016).  The inputs are the TAD bed files generated by TopDom and the script will output the shared TAD number.

To run TopDom, below is the example code we used:

#Generate sparse matrix format ending with bp.txt files using python script. 
#The 1st input is the path to hic file
#The 2nd input is the resolution, here we choose 50KB. Please specify this option according to your need.
#The 3rd input is the prefix for the output
```
python HiC_to_TopDom_format.py \
uni1945_2_billion.hic \
50000 \
2_Billion
```

#Generate topdom output
#The 1st input is the prefix
#The 2nd input is the resolution, here we choose 50KB. Please specify this option according to your need.
```
Rscript run_TopDom.R \
2_Billion \
50000
```

#Combine topdom output and produce final output topdom bed file with domain information
```
tail -n +2 *topdom.bed | grep -v '==>' > 2_Billion-50000-topdom.bed
```
For more usage instruction for TopDom, please refer to github page: https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/TopDom.

NOTE: We first run the 4DN Hi-C data processing pipeline (https://data.4dnucleome.org/resources/data-analysis/hi_c-processing-pipeline) to get the .hic file, which is the required input for TopDom.
