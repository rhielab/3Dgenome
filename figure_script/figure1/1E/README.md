## Figure1 Comparison of Hi-C and Micro-C data.

### 1E. Average chromatin interaction signals at shared loops (loops found in Hi-C and Micro-C) and unique loops. 

The pileup plots are generated by cooltools (https://github.com/open2c/cooltools). 

Here we provide a python script ```cooltools_pileup.py``` to generate pileup plot using coolstools. Below is the example code:

```
#To run cooltools_pileup.py, cooltools conda environment is required
#1st - mcool file
#2nd - loop file 
#3rd - output path
#4th - output prefix
python cooltools_pileup.py \
uni1945_1kb_1_billion.filt.mcool \
1_Billion_Mustache-2kb-all-loop.bedpe \
./output \
Micro_C_2kb_Mustache_Loop
```
