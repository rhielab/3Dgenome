## Figure1 Comparison of Hi-C and Micro-C data.

### 1E. Average chromatin interaction signals at shared loops (loops found in Hi-C and Micro-C) and unique loops. 

The pileup plots are generated by cooltools (https://github.com/open2c/cooltools). 

Here we provide a python script ```cooltools_pileup.py``` to generate pileup plot using coolstools. The required input file format is ```.mcool```. Below is the example code:


To run ```cooltools_pileup.py```, cooltools conda environment is required
- 1st - mcool file
- 2nd - loop file 
- 3rd - output path
- 4th - output prefix
```
python cooltools_pileup.py \
uni1945_1kb_1_billion.filt.mcool \
1_Billion_Mustache-2kb-all-loop.bedpe \
./output \
Micro_C_2kb_Mustache_Loop
```
